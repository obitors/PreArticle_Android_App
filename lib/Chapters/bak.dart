        'A number of years ago when I was working with psychotherapist Devers Branden, she put me through her "deathbed" exercise. I was asked to clearly imagine myself lying on my own deathbed, and tofully realize the feelings connected with dying and saying good-bye. Then she asked me to mentally invite the people in my life who wereimportant to me to visit my bedside, one at a time. As I visualized eachfriend and relative coming in to visit me, I had to speak to them outloud. I had to say to them what I wanted them to know as I was dying.As I spoke to each person, I could feel my voice breaking. Somehow I couldn\'t help breaking down. My eyes were filled with tears. Iexperienced such a sense of loss. It was not my own life I wasmourning; it was the love I was losing. To be more exact, it was acommunication of love that had never been there.During this difficult exercise, I really got to see how much I\'d left out ofmy life. How many wonderful feelings I had about my children, forexample, that I\'d never explicitly expressed.page_19Page 20At the end of the exercise, I was an emotional mess. I had rarely criedthat hard in my life. But when those emotions cleared, a wonderfulthing happened. I was clear. I knew what was really important, and whoreally mattered to me. I understood for the first time what GeorgePatton meant when he said, "Death can be more exciting than life."From that day on I vowed not to leave anything to chance. I made upmy mind never to leave anything unsaid. I wanted to live as if I mightdie any moment. The entire experience altered the way I\'ve related topeople ever since. And the great point of the exercise wasn\'t lost on me:We don\'t have to wait until we\'re actually near death to receive thesebenefits of being mortal. We can create the experience anytime wewant.A few years later when my mother lay dying in a hospital in Tucson, Irushed to her side to hold her hand and repeat to her all the love andgratitude I felt for who she had been for me. When she finally died, mygrieving was very intense, but very short. In a matter of days I felt thateverything great about my mother had entered into me and would livethere as a loving spirit forever.A year and a half before my father\'s death, I began to send him lettersand poems about his contribution to my life. He lived his last monthsand died in the grip of chronic illness, so communicating and gettingthrough to him in person wasn\'t always easy. But I always felt good thathe had those letters and poems to read. Once he called me after I\'d senthim a Father\'s Day poem, and he said, "Hey, I guess I wasn\'t such a badfather after all."Poet William Blake warned us about keeping our thoughts locked upuntil we die. "When thought is closed in caves," he wrote, "then love will show its roots in deepest hell."Pretending you aren\'t going to die is detrimental to your enjoyment oflife. It is detrimental in the same way that it would be detrimental for abasketball player to pretend there was no end to the game he wasplaying. That player would reduce his intensity, adopt a lazy playingstyle, and, of course, end up not having any fun at all. Without an end,there is no game. Without being conscious of death, you can\'t be fullyaware of the gift of life.Yet many of us (including myself) keep pretending that our life\'s gamewill have no end. We keep planning to do great things some day whenwe feel like it. We assign our goals and dreams to that imaginary islandin the sea that Denis Waitley calls "Someday Isle." We find ourselvessaying, "Someday I\'ll do this," and "Someday I\'ll do that."Confronting our own death doesn\'t have to wait until we run out of life.In fact, being able to vividly imagine our last hours on our deathbedcreates a paradoxical sensation: the feeling of being born all overagain—the first step to fearless self-motivation. "People living deeply,"wrote poet and diarist Anaïs Nin, "have no fear of death."And as Bob Dylan has sung, "He who is not busy being born is busydying."',
